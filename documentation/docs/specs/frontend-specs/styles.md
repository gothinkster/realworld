# Styles

We created a custom Bootstrap 4 style & templates to ensure all frontends had consistent UI functionality. Our [starter kit](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-starter-kit) includes all the [templates & info required to get up and running](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld-starter-kit/blob/master/FRONTEND_INSTRUCTIONS.md). 


Instead of having the Bootstrap theme included locally, we recommend loading the precompiled theme from our CDN (our [header template](#header) does this by default):

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="//demo.productionready.io/main.css">
```

Alternatively, if you want to make modifications to the theme, check out the [theme's repo](https://github.com/gothinkster/conduit-bootstrap-template).
