# Introduction

<a href="https://demo.realworld.io/"><img src={useBaseUrl('/img/conduit_l.png')} align="right" width="250px" /></a>

> See how *the exact same* Medium.com clone (called [Conduit](https://demo.realworld.io)) is built using different [frontends](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld?category=frontend) and [backends](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld?category=backend). Yes, you can mix and match them, because **they all adhere to the same [API spec](specs/backend-specs/introduction)** 😮😎

While most "todo" demos provide an excellent cursory glance at a framework's capabilities, they typically don't convey the knowledge & perspective required to actually build _real_ applications with it.

**RealWorld** solves this by allowing you to choose any frontend (React, Angular, & more) and any backend (Node, Django, & more) and see how they power a real world, beautifully designed fullstack app called [**Conduit**](https://demo.realworld.io).

- ["Introducing RealWorld 🙌"](https://medium.com/@ericsimons/introducing-realworld-6016654d36b5) by Eric Simons
- Every tutorial is built against the same [API spec](specs/backend-specs/introduction) to ensure modularity of every frontend & backend
- Every frontend utilizes the same hand crafted [Bootstrap 4 theme](https://github.com/gothinkster/conduit-bootstrap-template) for identical UI/UX
- There is a [hosted version](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/docs/specs/frontend-specs/api#demo-api) of the backend API available for public usage, no API keys are required
