# What is this?

RealWorld is a collection of exemplary frontend and backend codebases that demonstrate how to build real world, full stack applications. 

### Why?

While most demos/tutorials provide an excellent cursory glance at a framework's capabilities, they typically don't convey the knowledge & perspective required to actually build "real" applications with it.

### How does it work?

You can choose any frontend (React, Angular 2, etc) and any backend (Node, Django, etc) and see how they power a real world, beautifully designed fullstack app called "Conduit" [(demo)](https://react-redux.realworld.io).

### Wait, I can use _any_ frontend with _any_ backend?

Yup! The frontends & backends adhere to the same [API spec](api/), so you can mix & match any desired frontend/backend combo.


# What frontends and backends do you currently support?

All of our stacks are built & reviewed by the OSS community. We're always working to [add more stacks to this list](https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld/issues).

### Upcoming

[![Create a new stack](media/upcoming_stacks.png)](/spec)

Do you use any of these frameworks (or one that isn't listed)? **We need your help!**

[**Create a new framework implementation >>>**](/spec)

<br />

# How do I get up & running?

Simply follow the instructions in the README of whatever frontend and/or backend repo's you want to get up and running.

### Can you teach me how to build each stack from scratch?

Yup! We've built step-by-step tutorials for all of our stacks that teach you how to go from `git init` all the way to the production ready application. [**Start learning now >>>**](https://thinkster.io/tutorials/fullstack)

<br />

# Community created resources

Forks, tutorials, workshops, and other resources based on the RealWorld project:

- [**React+Redux / Node testing workshop**](https://github.com/kentcdodds/testing-workshop) by [**Kent C. Dodds**](https://github.com/kentcdodds)
  - Example repo showing the React+Redux and Node stacks working together w/ TDD

<br />

# Learn more

- Every tutorial is built against the same [API spec](api/) to ensure modularity of every frontend & backend 
- Every frontend utilizes the same hand crafted Bootstrap 4 theme for identical UI/UX
- There is a hosted version of the backend API available for public usage, no API keys required

## Special thanks to...

RealWorld wouldn't be possible without the help of the open source community reviewing codebases, creating new app implementations, and many other tasks that help push this project forward. We especially appreciate the OSS leaders who have helped contribute to RealWorld:

- **Dan Abramov** (creator of Redux) for  helping [spark the initial idea](https://twitter.com/dan_abramov/status/692009757775896577), [getting the Redux community involved](https://github.com/reactjs/redux/issues/1353), as well as graciously taking the time to provide feedback on the Redux codebase
- **Max Lynch** (creator of Ionic) for taking the time to provide guidance in the early days of this project
- **Addy Osmani** (creator of TodoMVC) for helping [spark the initial idea](https://twitter.com/addyosmani/status/762828483433144320) and his amazing work with TodoMVC
- **TodoMVC** ([team & contributors](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc#team)) for their exemplary & successful work; their project & org has been an invaluable analogy for us as we've built out RealWorld
- **James Brewer** (docs contributor to Django) for countless brainstorming sessions, helping name this project, and creating the Django codebase + tutorial
