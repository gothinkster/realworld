### See how [_the exact same_ Medium.com clone](https://demo.realworld.build) is built using different [frontends](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld?category=frontend) and [backends](https://codebase.show/projects/realworld?category=backend)

You can combine any frontend with any backend, because **they all adhere to the same API spec**.

While most "todo" demos provide an excellent cursory glance at a framework's capabilities, they typically don't convey the knowledge and perspective required to actually build _real_ applications with it.

**RealWorld** solves this by allowing you to choose any frontend (React, Angular, & more) and any backend (Node, Django, & more).

- Every tutorial is built against the same [API spec](https://realworld-docs.netlify.app/docs/specs/backend-specs/introduction) to ensure modularity of every frontend & backend  
- Every frontend utilizes the same handcrafted [Bootstrap 4 theme](https://github.com/gothinkster/conduit-bootstrap-template) for identical UI/UX  
- There is a hosted version of the backend API available for public usage, no API keys are required
